Main Diagonal Sum:
You are given a N X N integer matrix. You have to find the sum of all the main diagonal elements of A.
Main diagonal of a matrix A is a collection of elements A[i, j] such that i = j.


Problem Constraints:
1 <= N <= 103
-1000 <= A[i][j] <= 1000


Input Format:
There are 1 lines in the input. First 2 integers R, C are the number of rows and columns. Then R * C integers follow corresponding to the rowwise numbers in the 2D array A.


Output Format
Return an integer denoting the sum of main diagonal elements.


Example Input:
Input 1:
[1,  2, 3,  4],
[5,  6, 7,  8],
[9, 10, 11, 12]

Input 2:
{{2 2 3}, {2 2 3}, {5, 6, 7}}


Example Output:
Output 1:
 15

Output 2:
 6




 Minor Diagonal Sum:
 You are given a N X N integer matrix. You have to find the sum of all the minor diagonal elements of A.
 Minor diagonal of a M X M matrix A is a collection of elements A[i, j] such that i + j = M + 1 (where i, j are 1-based).


 Problem Constraints
 1 <= N <= 103
 -1000 <= A[i][j] <= 1000


 Input Format:
 First and only argument is a 2D integer matrix A.


 Output Format:
 Return an integer denoting the sum of minor diagonal elements.


 Example Input:
 Input 1:
  A = [[1, -2, -3],
       [-4, 5, -6],
       [-7, -8, 9]]

 Input 2:
  A = [[3, 2],
       [2, 3]]


 Example Output:
 Output 1:
  -5

 Output 2:
  4
